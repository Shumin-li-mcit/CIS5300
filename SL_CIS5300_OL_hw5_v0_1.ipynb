        "\n",
        "## Due Date: (TBD)\n",
        "## Total Points: 100 points\n",
        "- **Overview**: In this assignment, we will examine some advanced uses of vector representations of words. We are going to look at three different problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Solving word relation problems like analogies using word embeddings.\n",
        "  - Comparing correlation for human judgments of similarity to the vector similarities\n",
        "  - Discovering the different senses of a ‘polysemous’ word by clustering together its paraphrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Delieverables:** This assignment has several deliverables:\n",
        "  - Code (this notebook) *(Automatic Graded)*\n",
        "    - Part 1: answers to questions\n",
        "    - Part 3: 4 different clustering functions\n",
        "  - Write Up (Report.pdf) *(Manually Graded)*\n",
        "    - Part 2: answers to questions\n",
        "    - Part 3: F-scores for clustering algorithms & discussions about your models\n",
        "  - Leaderboard Without K *(Automatic Graded on GradeScope)*\n",
        "    - `test_nok_output_leaderboard.txt` = Task 3.4 output file\n",
        "  - Leaderboard With K *(Automatic Graded on GradeScope)*\n",
        "    - `test_output_leaderboard.txt` = Task 3.2 or 3.3 output file\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Grading**: We will use the auto-grading system called `PennGrader`. To complete the homework assignment, you should implement anything marked with `#TODO` and run the cell with `#PennGrader` note.\n",

        "**Background:** Word2vec is a very cool word embedding method that was developed by [Thomas Mikolov et al](https://aclanthology.org/N13-1090/). One of the noteworthy things about the method is that it can be used to solve word analogy problems like:\n",
        "\n",
        "***man is to king as woman is to [blank]***\n",
        "\n",
        "The way that it they take the vectors representing king, man and woman and perform some vector arithmetic to produce a vector that is close to the expected answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "***king − man + woman ≈ queen***\n",
        "\n",
        "We can find the nearest vector in the vocabulary by looking for argmax *cos(x, king − man + woman)*. Omar Levy has an explanation of the method in this [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-does-Mikolovs-word-analogy-for-word-embedding-work-How-can-I-code-such-a-function) and in the [paper](https://aclanthology.org/W14-1618/).\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to solving this sort of analogy problem, the same sort of vector arithmetic was used with word2vec embeddings to find relationships between pairs of words like the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_ewkcJ6EQMuIK0SrgBulzK7LFi8kD9nD'>\n",

        "In the first part of the assigment, you will play around with the [Magnitude](https://github.com/plasticityai/magnitude) library. You will use Magnitude to load a vector model trained using word2vec, and use it to manipulate and analyze the vectors. In order to proceed further, you need to use the Medium Google-word2vec embedding model trained on Google News by using file `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.magnitude`.

        "# Section 3: Creating Word Sense Clusters (80 points)\n",
        "**Background:** Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks require knowing the sense of polysemous words, which are words with multiple meanings. For example, the word bug can mean:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A creepy crawly thing\n",
        "2. An error in your computer code\n",
        "3. A virus or bacteria that makes you sick\n",
        "4. A listening device planted by the FBI\n",
        "\n",
        "In past research my PhD students and I have looked into automatically deriving the different meaning of polysemous words like bug by clustering their paraphrases. We have developed a resource called [the paraphrase database (PPDB)](http://paraphrase.org/) that contains of paraphrases for tens of millions words and phrases. For the target word bug, we have an unordered list of paraphrases including: insect, glitch, beetle, error, microbe, wire, cockroach, malfunction, microphone, mosquito, virus, tracker, pest, informer, snitch, parasite, bacterium, fault, mistake, failure and many others. We used automatic clustering group those into sets like:\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-YbbvZ0qwRKPiHZ1ZWOm62dfCkfu4tLJ'>\n",
        "\n",
        "The clusters in the image above approximate the different word senses of bug, where the 4 circles are the 4 senses of bug. The input to this problem is all the paraphrases in a single list, and the task is to separate them correctly. As humans, this is pretty intuitive, but computers are not that smart. You will explore the main idea underlying our word sense clustering method: which measure the similarity between each pair of paraphrases for a target word and then group together the paraphrases that are most similar to each other. This affinity matrix gives an example of one of the methods for measuring similarity that we tried in our [paper](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/publications/clustering-paraphrases-by-word-sense.pdf):\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1v1dBzwoSM3S3Y1wDUwqcVBEZ7GxxKKJ4'>\n",
        "\n",
        "Here the darkness values give an indication of how similar paraphrases are to each other. For instance in this example similarity between *insect* and *pest* is greater than the similarity between insect and error. You can read more about this task in [these](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/publications/clustering-paraphrases-by-word-sense.pdf) [papers](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cdimarco/pdf/cs886/Pantel+Lin02.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, we will use vector representations in order to measure their similarities of pairs of paraphrases. You will play with different vector space representations of words to create clusters of word senses. We expect that you have read Jurafsky and Martin [Chapter 6](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf). Word vectors, also known as word embeddings, can be thought of simply as points in some high-dimensional space. Remember in geometry class when you learned about the Euclidean plane, and 2-dimensional points in that plane? It’s not hard to understand distance between those points – you can even measure it with a ruler. Then you learned about 3-dimensional points, and how to calculate the distance between these. These 3-dimensional points can be thought of as positions in physical space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, do your best to stop thinking about physical space, and generalize this idea in your mind: you can calculate a distance between 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional points, now imagine a point with `N` dimensions. The dimensions don’t necessarily have meaning in the same way as the X,Y, and Z dimensions in physical space, but we can calculate distances all the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how we will use word vectors in this assignment: as points in some high-dimensional space, where distances between points are meaningful. The interpretation of distance between word vectors depends entirely on how they were made, but for our purposes, we will consider distance to measure semantic similarity. Word vectors that are close together should have meanings that are similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this framework, we can see how to solve our paraphrase clustering problem."

Once we predict a clustering solution for the paraphrase set, we similarly generate the set of word pairs such that both words in the pair appear in the same predicted cluster. We can then evaluate our set of predicted pairs against the ground truth pairs using precision, recall, and F-score.\n",

You will calculate cooccurrence vectors on the Reuters RCV1 corpus. It can take a long time to build cooccurrence vectors, so we have pre-built set called `coocvec-500mostfreq-window-3.vec.filter.magnitude`. To save on space, these include only the words used in the given files. This representation of words uses a term-context matrix `M` of size `|V| x D`, where `|V|` is the size of the vocabulary and D=500. Each feature corresponds to one of the top 500 most-frequent words in the corpus. The value of matrix entry `M[i][j]` gives the number of times the context word represented by column `j` appeared within W=3 words to the left or right of the word represented by row `i` in the corpus.\n",
